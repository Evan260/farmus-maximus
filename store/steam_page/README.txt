FARMUS MAXIMUS: STEAM STORE PAGE FILES

Everything the Steam store page needs, ready to upload in Steamworks (partner.steamgames.com). Open the game's app,
then Edit Store Page. Steamworks shows the exact size it wants on each upload slot; if a size there differs from the
file name here, tell Claude and the picture will be remade.

The pictures are made by python tools/steam/make_store_art.py, which has the game render each scene, so they always
match the game. Run it again after the art changes.

STORE GRAPHICS (Graphical Assets tab, Store Assets)

header_capsule_920x430.png     Header capsule: top of the store page and in most lists
small_capsule_462x174.png      Small capsule: search results and smaller lists
main_capsule_1232x706.png      Main capsule: the front page's featured carousel
vertical_capsule_748x896.png   Vertical capsule: seasonal sales and some store pages
page_background_1438x810.png   Page background: behind the store page (optional)


LIBRARY GRAPHICS (Graphical Assets tab, Library Assets)

library_capsule_600x900.png         Library capsule: the game's cover in players' libraries
library_header_920x430.png          Library header
library_hero_3840x1240.png          Library hero: the wide picture at the top of the game's library page (no logo, on purpose)
library_logo_1280_transparent.png   Library logo: laid over the hero by Steam; place it to the bottom left


ICONS (Basic Info and the Community section)

community_icon_184x184.jpg   Community icon
app_icon.ico                 Client icon (also usable as the game's own Windows icon)


SCREENSHOTS (Screenshots tab)

screenshots/01 to 11, all 1920x1080. 02, the farm along the bottom of a desktop, is made only once a screenshot of
a real desktop is saved as marketing/desktop.png. Upload them in this order; the first four show in the store page's sidebar and in
search, so they lead with the estate, the desktop strip, a workshop window and the vineyard.


TRAILER (Trailers tab)

The trailer is rendered to marketing/recordings/videos/steam_trailer.avi (kept out of git because of its size) by
python tools/trailer/make_trailer.py. Steam wants an .mp4; once ffmpeg is installed (winget install Gyan.FFmpeg),
Claude can add the conversion. Before uploading, confirm with the composer of the harp music (Mythago Music) that it
may be used in a trailer.


STILL TO DECIDE BEFORE SUBMITTING

- Developer and publisher name (your own name or a studio name).
- Release date: "Coming soon", or a season and year such as "Spring 2027".
- Price, which Steamworks asks for separately and which Valve reviews.
- Steam Cloud, achievements and the demo are set up as described in design/Steam-setup.md.
